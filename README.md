# Novus Crypto Currency Exchange

A DApp to showcase my developer skills on the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. Has a native cryptocurrency called 'Novus' (NOV) that can be traded on the decentralised exchange with Ethereum (ETH).

If you wish to see the NOV in your wallet, first go to the assets tab and at the bottom click on import tokens.
